##  Strategy:
The main of the program is to implement the project using object-oriented
programming in Java so as to make the program efficient.

## MOTIVATION
The project is helpful to remove the existing system of restaurant’s handling
customers. It removes the need of managing huge data in paper work and instead
helps maintain data in system files which can be modified as and when required easily
without any additional requirements. Earlier restaurant’s used to manual compute the
bill and this seemed to cause several human errors but now with such applications
users can accurately get their bills with additional discounts as and when available.
